## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a local copy of Berai up and running for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

- PHP 8.2+
- Composer
- Node.js & npm
- PostgreSQL

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/putralangkat97/berai.git
    cd berai
    ```

2.  **Install backend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

3.  **Install frontend dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **Set up your environment file:**
    Copy the example environment file and generate your application key.

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

5.  **Configure your `.env` file:**
    Open the `.env` file and update your database credentials for PostgreSQL.

    ```dotenv
    DB_CONNECTION=pgsql
    DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
    DB_PORT=5432
    DB_DATABASE=your_database
    DB_USERNAME=your_postgres_user
    DB_PASSWORD=your_postgres_password
    ```

6.  **Run database migrations:**
    This will create all the necessary tables, including the activity log table.

    ```bash
    php artisan migrate
    ```

7.  **Create the storage link:**
    This makes uploaded files (like avatars) publicly accessible.

    ```bash
    php artisan storage:link
    ```

8.  **Run the development servers:**
    You'll need to run both the Vite server (for frontend assets) and the Laravel server.
    - In one terminal, run:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```
    - In a second terminal, run:
      ```bash
      php artisan serve
      ```

You can now access the application at `http://localhost:8000`!
